          <p>To renew your passport in London, you will need to follow these general steps:</p>
          <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
           
            <li>Check the validity: Verify that your passport is actually expired or will expire within the next six months. Most countries require you to have at least six months of validity remaining on your passport before allowing entry.

            </li>
            <li><p class="govuk-body">Gather required documents: Collect the necessary documents for your passport renewal. Typically, you will need the following:</p></li>
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>apples</li>
                <li>oranges</li>
                <li>pears</li></ul>

            <li>Complete the application form: Fill out the passport renewal application form accurately and thoroughly. You can either obtain the form from the passport office or complete it online through the official government website.</li>

           <li> Make an appointment: Visit the official website of Her Majesty's Passport Office (HMPO) and schedule an appointment at the nearest passport office in London. This step is crucial as you will need to attend an in-person appointment to submit your application.</li>

           <li> Attend the appointment: On the scheduled date and time, go to the designated passport office. Bring all the required documents, including the completed application form and photographs. During the appointment, your documents will be reviewed, and you may need to provide biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, digital photo).</li>

           <li>Pay the fee: Passport renewal incurs a fee, which you will need to pay during the appointment. The fee varies depending on the type of passport, processing time, and whether you are applying for a standard or premium service.</li>


           <li>Track your application: After submitting your renewal application, you will receive a receipt or reference number. Use this to track the progress of your application online or through the official passport helpline.</li>


           <li> <strong> Collect your new passport:</strong> Once your application is processed and approved, you will be notified to collect your new passport. The notification will provide instructions on where and when to pick it up. Make sure to bring the receipt or reference number, as well as your old passport for cancellation.</li>

              </ul>
          </ol>
         <p>Please note that the passport renewal process and requirements may change over time. It's always best to visit the official government website or contact the passport office directly for the most up-to-date information regarding passport renewal in London.</p>
